<h1>Welcome to the backstory of the number seven...</h1>
<h2>Be warned, it is not pleasant...</h2>
<h3>Once, in the quaint town of Ravenswood, there stood an ancient mansion known as the Eldritch Manor. Legend had it that the mansion harbored a sinister secret linked to the cursed number seven. Many whispered about the mysterious occurrences that took place every seventh hour of the seventh day of the seventh month.

Curiosity got the better of a group of friends â€“ Emma, Alex, Jake, and Lily. Intrigued by the tales surrounding Eldritch Manor, they decided to spend the night there on the fateful seventh day of the seventh month.

As the clock struck midnight, the group found themselves in the dimly lit halls of the mansion. The air grew colder with every step they took, and an eerie silence settled over the old walls. A strange sensation permeated the atmosphere, as if unseen eyes were watching their every move.

As they explored the mansion, they discovered a room with seven dusty mirrors arranged in a peculiar pattern. The friends stared into the mirrors, captivated by the reflection of their own fear-stricken faces. Suddenly, the mirrors began to shudder, emitting a low, otherworldly hum. The room plunged into darkness, and when the lights flickered back on, one mirror was missing.

A voice echoed through the mansion, whispering, "Seven mirrors, seven souls. Choose one, and the curse takes its toll."

Panic set in as the group realized they were trapped in a malevolent game. Reluctantly, they chose one mirror, and in an instant, the chosen mirror shattered with an ear-piercing scream. The friends stumbled back, horrified, as the shattered glass formed the shape of a ghastly figure, a manifestation of the mansion's curse.

The figure spoke, its voice echoing with the anguish of past victims, "For seven generations, the curse has fed on the fear of those who dared to defy it. The seventh hour claims another, and the cycle continues."

The friends desperately tried to escape the mansion, but every door they opened led them back to the cursed room with the remaining mirrors. The figure of shattered glass loomed closer with every failed attempt.

As the clock struck the seventh hour, the room filled with an otherworldly glow, and the friends felt an icy grip on their souls. In that moment, they became part of the cursed mirrors, forever bound to Eldritch Manor. The legend of the Seventh Hour lived on, whispered by those who dared to speak of the haunted mansion, warning others to never tempt the curse of seven.</h3>
