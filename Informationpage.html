			<h1>The history of numberseven.xyz!</h1>
			<h2>This website wasnt always the website it is now</h2>
			<p>
				I am the owner of this website, You can call me Danum. When I first made this website, I wasnt exactly sure what I wanted it for. First, I made the index.html page, which was just a 
				gloomy blue background, with text saying NUMBERSEVEN.XYZ. I had made the website just to learn a new programming language, I wanted to do something easy, like HTML. I had done a bit of python 
				already but was too stupid to learn C++ or C#, so I stuck with HTML. I made a python script that would print the 7 times tables, that you could download on the website. I added an info page,
				and a ritual page??? I do not know what was going through my mind at the time. But I made my own ritual? for praying to the number seven lords... Dont ask... Then, not liking the way the website
				looked, I got a friend who knew html and css well to improve the website, and add the navigation panel at the top, and the blue to green tertiary gradient as the background. I then wanted to
				improve my programming skills, trying to move on to C and C++, which I did okay at... I had one dream in mind however, to make a working operatin system. just something that can be booted
				from your motherboard, and will open a simple terminal, that you can add or remove files, edit files, etc. Which was definitely a dream, not a reality. Little did I know, that is not something 
				you just "do", and I learned a valuable lesson. programming isnt a walk in the park, its more of a run on top of a volcano while it is raining acid, kind of walk. In other words, Programming hard.
